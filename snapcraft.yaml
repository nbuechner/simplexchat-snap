summary: The first messaging platform that has no user identifiers of any kind
description: |
             SimpleX Chat is a private and secure messaging app that emphasizes privacy by not using user IDs,
             including phone numbers or random identifiers. Instead, it uses temporary anonymous pairwise identifiers for message delivery,
             ensuring no long-term identifiers exist. The app features end-to-end encryption, decentralized groups,
             and anonymous credentials to enhance security. Users can control their data, avoid spam and abuse,
             and connect via servers or Tor for added privacy.
